# Easy BikePackr
The application creates a personalized packing checklist for your upcoming bike trip, taking into consideration your specific requirements
such as special equipment due to your chosen accommodation or travel pace (competitive or leisurely).
The app allows you to view both an overview and detailed checklists, as well as create, edit, and delete checklists as needed.
